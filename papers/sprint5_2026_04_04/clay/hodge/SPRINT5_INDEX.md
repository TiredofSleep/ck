## Sprint Summary

Nine computation memos progressing from the contaminated A₁ model to the first uncontaminated Hodge obstruction on A_*.

### Progression

| Step | Memo | Object | Key Finding |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | HODGE_SIMPLE_WEIL_MEMO | A₁ (non-product, rational Ω) | Weil class computed (28-term rational 4-form); span test fails; dim=2 anomaly found |
| 2 | HODGE_HIDDEN_STRUCTURE_MEMO | A₁ — root cause | ANY Ω = iM (rational) gives End⁰ = M₄(Q(i)); simple Weil 4-fold requires transcendental period matrix |
| 3 | HODGE_NUMERICAL_SIMPLE_MEMO | A_* (irrational Ω) | First uncontaminated Weil 4-fold; End⁰ = Q(i) confirmed; 8D obstruction space; algebraic dict rank = 0 |
| 4 | HODGE_8D_OBSTRUCTION_MEMO | A_* — internal structure | W_* = B₁⊕B₂⊕B₃⊕B₄; Galois pairing; Rosati(φ)=−φ; Q-eigenvalues 0.0046, 0.0231, 0.1156, 0.3834 |
| 5 | HODGE_B1_CYCLE_CONSTRAINT_MEMO | B₁ constraints | All standard cycle types excluded (divisor products, endomorphism graphs, Lefschetz multiples, K-invariant combinations) |
| 6 | HODGE_BOX_CLOSURE_TEST_B1 | B₁ box test | **CASE 2 — CLEAN OBSTRUCTION**: no sub-torus closes B₁ at height ≤ 2; B₁ is a real invariant (degeneracy break confirmed) |
| 7 | HODGE_B1_PROJECTION_HUNT | Z_anti family | First K-anti-invariant near-primitive family; CASE B (S=0.013, ‖L∧Z‖≈0.09) |
| 8 | HODGE_B1_HUNT_PROCEED | Z_anti scale test | 23/2000 near-primitive hits; S does not collapse; scale law S ~ 0.03·‖L∧Z‖ |
| 9 | HODGE_B1_PRIMITIVITY_LOCUS | Z_anti ruled out | **CASE C+**: primitive locus is exactly {φ-stable 2-planes}; Z_anti = 0 at every primitive point |

### Structural Extension (same sprint, same directory)

Three structural memos closing all known cycle constructions:

| Memo | Finding |
|------|---------|
| HODGE_PURE_MIXED_THEOREM | φ-stable J-stable cycles always have det_R = +1 (K-invariant); anti-sym family closes the only K-anti-inv route from sub-tori |
| HODGE_SINGLE_CYCLE_IMPOSSIBILITY | Three independent proofs: polarization preservation + simplicity + pure/mixed det = CH²(A_*)^known K-anti-inv part = 0 |
| HODGE_WEIL_CLASS_FRONTIER | B₁ is the minimal Hodge obstruction; three remaining routes (bundle, correspondence, abs. Hodge); frontier map |

## Key Results

### Confirmed
- A_* has End⁰ = Q(i) (real joint commutant dim = 4, verified at 6 independent rational parameter points)
- W_* = 8-dimensional K-anti-invariant primitive (2,2) subspace; algebraic primitive dictionary rank = 0
- W_* decomposes as B₁⊕B₂⊕B₃⊕B₄ under Hodge-Riemann Q-form; each block is 2D (exact Galois pairing)
- B₁ is a real invariant: distinguishes Z_a = L² + 0.1·w_{B₁} from Z_b = L² + 0.1·w_{B₂} despite identical classical data
- Non-factorization: B₁ projection from any divisor product or linear combination thereof is < 2×10⁻¹³
- Z_anti family is K-anti-invariant by construction but structurally incapable of producing a nonzero primitive B₁ class

### Open
- Whether any algebraic cycle Z ∈ CH²(A_*)_Q has cl²(Z) ∈ B₁ (the Hodge conjecture for this block on A_*)
- Whether a K-anti-equivariant coherent sheaf exists on A_* (bundle route)
- Whether a correspondence Γ ∈ CH²(A_* × A_*) can give K-anti-invariant diagonal restriction (correspondence route)
- Whether B₁ is absolutely Hodge (Deligne, p-adic/ℓ-adic realization check)
