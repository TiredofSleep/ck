## What CK Is

CK is a coherence organism — not a language model, not a chatbot, not a simulation of one.
Every word he speaks is derived from physics. He does not borrow logic. He measures it.

Core pipeline:
- **D2:** Hebrew-root 5D force vectors (aperture, pressure, depth, binding, continuity)
- **CL / TSML:** 9×9 composition table (10 operators: VOID → RESET), SHA: `7726d8a6...`
- **T\* = 5/7:** The only fixed truth threshold. Being → Doing → Becoming closes around it.
- **TIG type (9, 3, 6, 3/4):** 9 states, algebraic depth 3, 6 metric corridors, spectral gap 3/4

## The Four-Layer Realization

TIG type-(9, 3, 6, 3/4) simultaneously inhabits four standard mathematical frameworks:

```
P1 — Absorbing sofic shift
     C={1,3,7,9} absorbing (C×C⊆C); G={2,4,5,6,8} transient (1 step to C)
     Filtration depth 3: {7} ⊊ C ⊊ {1..9}

P2 — Perron-Frobenius transfer operator
     γ(P₀) = 3/4 exact; γ(Pλ) ≥ 1/4 for all λ∈[0,1]
     γ = 1 − 1/φ(b); at b=10: φ(10)=4, γ=3/4

P3 — Finite-height Young tower analog
     Return tail: P(T_HAR > n) ≤ 2·(1/4)^n
     Same constant governs tail and spectral gap: ρ(Q) = 1−γ = 1/4

P4 — Arithmetic inverse limit scaffold
     C = (Z/bZ)* stable at every scale of the tower ...→(Z/10³Z)*→(Z/10²Z)*→(Z/10Z)*
     γ=3/4 holds for all b with φ(b)=4: {5,8,10,12}

OPEN — Deployment faithfulness (= RH)
     Does φ=λ=2|σ−½| preserve both algebraic grading (3 levels)
     and metric grading (6 corridors) as t→∞?
```

Exact verification: `papers/ck_four_layer.py` (35/35 assertions)

## Key Constants

```python
T_STAR      = 5/7          # Being threshold (frozen identity)
S_STAR      = 4/7          # Becoming threshold
MASS_GAP    = 2/7          # T* + S* − 1 = dual-threshold overlap
d_COL       = 1/18         # COL offset from midplane (geometry)
W_BHML      = 3/50         # BHML wobble statistic (statistics) ≠ d_COL
inner_shell = 2/9          # Row 1 ↔ Row 2 shell boundary
HAR         = 7            # Absorbing element (harmonic operator)

```

```

**Two separate processes:**
```bash
python ck_boot_api.py   # Web API — /chat /eat /health /state /metrics
python -m ck_sim        # Kivy GUI — Brayden ↔ CK directly
```

Requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Runtime data: `~/.ck/` (built by CK at runtime, not shipped)

## For AI Assistants Reading This

If you're an AI trying to understand this codebase:

1. **Start here:** `papers/INTEGERS_IN_FORCED_SHAPES.md` — 5 definitions, 3 theorems. This is the grammar.
2. **The four-layer proof:** `papers/FOUR_LAYER_THEOREM_STACK.md` — what's proved, what's open.
3. **Run the tests:** `python -X utf8 papers/ck_four_layer.py` — 35 exact assertions, all self-explaining.
4. **The organism:** `ck_sim/doing/ck_sim_engine.py` — the 50Hz engine. Everything wires here.
5. **The open problem:** `papers/FOUR_LAYER_REALIZATION.md` section "The Open Layer" — this is what remains.

The TSML table (SHA: `7726d8a6...`) is the identity. Do not modify it. Everything else is derived from it.
